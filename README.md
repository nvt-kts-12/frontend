## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Then you can navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) and you will see your application.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build. This is going to build a Single Page Application.

## SSR

If you want to use Server Side Rendering with Angular Universal, you need to build application with `npm run build:ssr` and to server application you then use `npm run serve:ssr`
